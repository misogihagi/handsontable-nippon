    Handsontable includes many features and plugins. By "feature" we mean a functionality that provides you with a
    specific benefit. It can be literally anything, even the smallest thing like the navigation or the data binding
    capabilities. A plugin, on the other hand, is intended to be perceived as an internal or external "container" that
    contains one or more features.
